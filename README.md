# Lab-1

### Setup Instructions
1. Enter the [Digital](Digital) folder.
2. Execute `bash Digital.sh` to start the application.
3. Please go through the tutorial triggered to learn how to build a circuit.

+ For each component, hover over the pins to know the usage
+ For a component, right clicking allows you to change its parameters

## Q1 (2 points)
1. Create a combinatorial circuit to map the output of the 2-bit counter to the control pins of the 7-edge display
    - Replace the 2bitdisplay_component with your combinatorial circuit
    - Construct the other components i.e, input, clock, counter and display as shown in the image
2. The final file (q1.dig) must contain the full circuit
3. You are allowed to use the counter, splitter and 7-edge display components available in the tool
4. Use only the NOT gate and 2-input AND,OR,NAND,NOR,XOR gates

Note: Display should start with 0. Clock should be set to real time with frequency of 1Hz.
